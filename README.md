The game you all know and love. Soon it will be here!

## Installation and dependencies
This game requires ncurses. Curses would probably work too, try and rewrite some and includes and see for yourself if you're an adventurous type!

To install run the following command after cloning: `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

Then you can run the game by running `./main`
